### Main Idea:
#### Create a page where people can shop for different types of water proof technology.
### Visual Brainstorm:
#### Organize with Bootstrap menu.
#### Add drop down menu and search bar in navbar.
#### Use embed function to show different pictures of technology.
#### Use hrefs to embed links to personal about pages. Also use hrefs to send users to different places based on what they click.
