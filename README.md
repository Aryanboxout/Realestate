### Idea
####Create a page where people can look at different kinds of fish. They will be able to see what kind of pet fish they might like as well as fish they can find in the wild.
### Visual thoughts
#### Organize with Bootstrap menu. 
#### Add drop down menu and search bar in navbar. 
#### Use embed function to show different pictures of fish. 
####Use hrefs to embed links to personal about pages. Also use hrefs to send users to different places based on what they click.

### Implementation progress (September 8th, 2021)
#### Updated ReadMe and ensured any previous problems with greet code is fixed. Will be using greet to help with writing about page.

### IDE management (things that happened beyond plan)
#### Recall on ".gitignore" solution to the pains of temporary files.  Start a ".gitignore" and avoid promoting temporary files to Git, for instance IDE xml files.
#### A project needs to establish a "requirements.txt" to keep track of Python packages used by the project.  This help in other IDEs and Deployment.  IntelliJ has menu Tool -> Sync Python Requirements to start file.
